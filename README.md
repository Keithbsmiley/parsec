# parsec

A colorscheme created using
[color-builder](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/color-builder). This
uses [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized)
templates with custom colors to create a dark theme with proper
highlighting.

## Examples

![vim example]()
![iTerm example]()
![Xcode example]()

### New applications

If you'd like this to work with your favorite text editor please look
at the
[color-builder](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/color-builder)
repository which generates these themes and follow those guidelines.

If you'd just like to ask me to setup compatibility with another
application please [submit an
issue](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/color-builder/issues).

### Notes

There is a [separate vim
repo](https://github.com/Keithbsmiley/parsec.vim) so you don't have to
clone all of this excess when using vundle/pathogen etc.
